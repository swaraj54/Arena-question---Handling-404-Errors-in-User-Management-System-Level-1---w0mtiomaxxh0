/*
You need to implement an error handler function, "handleNotFoundErrors", that will handle 404 Not Found errors in a web application. The function takes two parameters: "res" representing the response object and "errorMessage" containing the error message to be sent in the response.

The function should set the status of the response to 404 and send a JSON response with an "error" key containing the provided error message. This error handler will be responsible for handling cases where the requested resource is not found, providing a meaningful error message to the client.
*/

const handleNotFoundErrors = (/*Add Necessary parameters*/) => {
    //Write your code here
};

module.exports = handleNotFoundErrors;
